ANN HyperParameter Tune:

1. Layers:

| Number of Hidden Layers | Result |

 0 - Only capable of representing linear separable functions or decisions.

 1 - Can approximate any function that contains a continuous mapping
from one finite space to another.

 2 - Can represent an arbitrary decision boundary to arbitrary accuracy
with rational activation functions and can approximate any smooth
mapping to any accuracy.
