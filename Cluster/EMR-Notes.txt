1. Try to run "/dl4j-spark/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/emr/EmrSparkExample.java" 
	
	a. You need to modify "/deeplearning4j-examples-parent/pom.xml", change Spark_1 to Spark_2, and then rebuild the project: (mvn clean package)
	b. modify code below in EmrSparkExample.java: 

		new JobFlowInstancesConfig().withEc2KeyName("spark") 
		to 
		new JobFlowInstancesConfig().withEc2KeyName("sunday9")

2. I have uploaded dataset in s3://input, and the example.jar in s3://Jar folder. If you create clusters on the website directly, you can also use these file to run a demo.

3. I don't install the CLI, I will try this afternoon. I am gonna sleep:)
