1. I got "The given SSH key name was invalid" error, and I failed to create cluster by using java Code. I can't figure out why.

2. Try to run "/dl4j-spark/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/emr/EmrSparkExample.java" 
	
	a. You need to modify "/deeplearning4j-examples-parent/pom.xml", change Spark_1 to Spark_2, and then rebuild the project: (mvn clean package)

3. I have uploaded dataset in s3://input, and the example.jar in s3://Jar folder. If you create clusters on the website directly, you can use these file to run a demo.
